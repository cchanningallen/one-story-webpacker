## Status

* First session was just experimenting. Decided to stick with this to fully vet webpacker, and to make non-react views (looking at you, ActiveAdmin) work on Heroku without a hitch.

* Next time:
  * Finish refactoring React components from the original one-story repo into this one
  * Git init and deploy
  * Add AdminUser & User auth
  * Get text-to-record working
